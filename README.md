COMET TRAILS
============

Project Description
-------
The "IMEX Comet trails" project is an ESA-funded project run at the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart to characterize dust trails produced by comets in the inner solar system. We want to predict meteor showers at any position or time in the solar system: for example, can we predict meteor storms at spacecraft or at other planets?; can we understand how dust produced by comets disperses to form the interplanetary
dust cloud?

Software
-------
The comet trails project includes two parts: 
(1) the particle integrator - for integrating the orbits of input dust particles. 
(2) the particle analyser - for analysing the results of these integrations

Each contains code + a test case.
