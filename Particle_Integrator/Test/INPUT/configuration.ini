[particles]

; FIRST_PARTICLE_NUMBER is the number of the first particle in the particle file.
; FIRST_PARTICLE_NUMBER		=1
 
; PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME is the name of the particle file in the INPUT folder, e.g. "particle_input_file". (no ".txt" needed)
PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME	=workunit_1000095_sepangle4_vel1_mass1e-08_HOR_1
 
; PARTICLE_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME is the name of the out put particle file. (Put something like "particle")
; Default is whatever PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME is. Particle number will be appended.
;PARTICLE_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME	=particle
 
; PARTICLE_MASS is the mass of the particles in kg. (e.g. "1e-06")
; Default is 0. In this case solar pressure is unaccounted for in the simulation.
PARTICLE_MASS				= 1e-08
 
; PARTICLE_DENSITY is the density of the particles in kg.m-3. (e.g. "1000")
; Default is 1000.
PARTICLE_DENSITY				=1000.000000
 
[simulation]
 
; FINAL_TIME is the date the simulation will end. The string needs to be compatible with SPICE, e.g. "1 JAN 2000".
FINAL_TIME	=1 JAN 2100
 
; START_TIME_SAVE is the date the saving of the particles will commence. The string needs to be compatible with SPICE, e.g. "1 JAN 2000". If this is zero, every state is saved. 
START_TIME_SAVE	=1 JAN 1950
 
; N_BODYS is the number of heavy bodys which will be included in the simulation. (must be greater than 0)
N_BODYS		=9
 
; BODYS_ID includes the NAIF IDs of the heavy bodys included in the simulation separated by spaces , e.g. "10 3 5". This example would be Sun(10) + Earth(3) + Jupiter(5).
; Sun(10) must always be set!
BODYS_ID	=10 5 6 7 8 3 2 4 1
 
; DV_STEP is the change of velocity allowed per step. Set this to "10e-5" for moderate accuracy or "1e-5" for good accuracy.
DV_STEP		=1e-3
 
; SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER sets the multiplier such that (DV_STEP^-1)*SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER describes which nth state is saved to the particle file. (decrease if you want higher state density)
; Default is (DV_STEP^-1)*20 .
SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER	=10
 
; NUMBER_OF_THREADS is the number of threads, in case you want to use more than 1 thread.
; Note that this parameter is NOT intended to be set if the application is running with BOINC.
; Default is 1.
;NUMBER_OF_THREADS = 1
