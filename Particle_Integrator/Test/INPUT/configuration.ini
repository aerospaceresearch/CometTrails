; ParticleIntegrator configuration


[particles]

; FIRST_PARTICLE_NUMBER is the number of the first particle in the particle file.
; FIRST_PARTICLE_NUMBER		=1
 
; PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME is the name of the particle file in the INPUT folder, e.g. "particle_input_file". (no ".txt" needed)
PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME	=workunit_1000095_sepangle4_vel1_mass1e-08_HOR_1
 
; PARTICLE_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME is the name of the out put particle file. (Put something like "particle")
; Default is whatever PARTICLE_INPUT_FILE_NAME is. Particle number will be appended.
;PARTICLE_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME	=particle
 
; PARTICLE_MASS is the mass of the particles in kg. (e.g. "1e-06")
; Default is 0. In this case solar pressure is unaccounted for in the simulation.
PARTICLE_MASS				=1e-08
 
; PARTICLE_DENSITY is the density of the particles in kg.m-3. (e.g. "1000")
; Default is 1000.
PARTICLE_DENSITY				=1000.000000
 
; Q_PR is the Mie scattering coefficient of a particle
; Default is 1.
Q_PR						=1.0
 
 
[simulation]

; ALGORITHM used for integration. Available: RK4, RK76 (default)
ALGORITHM					=RK76
 
; FINAL_TIME is the date the simulation will end. The string needs to be compatible with SPICE, e.g. "1 JAN 2000".
FINAL_TIME	=1 JAN 2100
 
; START_TIME_SAVE is the date the saving of the particles will commence. The string needs to be compatible with SPICE, e.g. "1 JAN 2000". If this is zero, every state is saved. 
START_TIME_SAVE	=1 JAN 1950
 
; N_BODYS is the number of heavy bodys which will be included in the simulation. (must be greater than 0)
N_BODYS		=9
 
; BODYS_ID includes the NAIF IDs of the heavy bodys included in the simulation separated by spaces , e.g. "10 3 5". This example would be Sun(10) + Earth(3) + Jupiter(5).
; Sun(10) must always be set!
BODYS_ID	=10 5 6 7 8 3 2 4 1
 
; NUMBER_OF_THREADS is the number of threads, in case you want to use more than 1 thread.
; Note that this parameter is NOT intended to be set if the application is running with BOINC.
; Default is 1.
NUMBER_OF_THREADS =1

; SSB_CENTERED = 1 to center bodies in the SSB instead of using actual positions through spice. Default: 0
SSB_CENTERED	=0

; ENDONTIME = 1 reduces the duration of the last integration step to make it end exactly on the given end time.
ENDONTIME		=1


[saving]

; SAVE_AS_BINARY defines whether or not the output files should be converted to binary format.
SAVE_AS_BINARY	=1
 
; Decrease if you want higher state density.
; Default is (DV_STEP^-1)*20 .
; 0. saves every 10nth state independently of the value of DV_STEP/E_TARGET.
; RK4:
; SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER sets the multiplier such that (DV_STEP^-1)*SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER describes which nth state is saved to the particle file.
; RK76:
; SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER sets the multiplier such that the number of steps that is saved is similar to the number that is saved when using RK4 with the same parameter, 
;  and is similar across values of E_TARGET
; More precisely, SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER / 1.4e3 * 10^(3.6072 - 0.0746 * log10( E_TARGET )) describes which nth state is saved.
SAVE_NTH_MULTIPLIER	=10.0

; ENCOUNTER_SLOPE defines the saving increase at the point where solar acceleration = planetary acceleration. Default: 4
ENCOUNTER_SLOPE		=4

; ENCOUNTER_MAX defines the maximum increase in save rate allowed. Default: 40
ENCOUNTER_MAX		=40


[encounter]

; ONLY_ENCOUNTERS: Only save particles coming closer than ENCOUNTER_RAD to ENCOUNTER_INT into binary. Default: 0
ONLY_ENCOUNTERS		=0

; ENCOUNTER_INT: Body to which encounters are measured (e.g. 3 = Earth, Default)
ENCOUNTER_INT	=3

; ENCOUNTER_RAD: Radius [km] below which an encounter is recognized. Default: 1.0e7
ENCOUNTER_RAD	=7.5e6


; Integrator-specific settings below:

[rk4]

; DV_STEP is the change of velocity allowed per step. Set this to "1e-3" for moderate accuracy or "1e-4" for good accuracy.
DV_STEP			=1e-3


[rk76]

; E_MIN is the smallest error allowed per step, in 10^3 m. Default is 1e-18.
E_TARGET		=1e-20

; IORDER defines the order of the interpolation of body positions. 0 disables interpolation. 
; Valid values: 0, 2, 5
IORDER			=5
